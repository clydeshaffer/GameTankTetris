# GameTank Tetris

Implentation of Tetris for the GameTank 8-bit video game console

written in C using the WDC02CC compiler from WDC

uses zlib6502 by pfusik

Currently not planning to continue developing on the branch written for the WDC compiler, as the cc65 builds were consistently faster and smaller.
